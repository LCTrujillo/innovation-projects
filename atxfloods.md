Here you’ll find an overview of the progress being made on the redesign of ATXfloods.com, a partnership between the [Design, Technology, and Innovation (DTI) Fellows](https://cityofaustin.github.io/innovation-fellows/) and the [Flood Emergency Warning System (FEWS)](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/flood-early-warning-system) here at the City of Austin. We’ll be outlining the research and design methods used by the Fellows, and key project outcomes.

We had some assumptions and baseline requirements heading into this project. We hope that by following our story, you’ll learn from the methods we used how we challenged and/or confirmed those assumptions though research and find this useful for any projects you wish to undertake.

If you have questions or comments, we would love to hear from you.
