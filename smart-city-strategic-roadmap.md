On November 3, 2016, Austin City Council passed a resolution calling for the development of a Smart City Strategic Roadmap with relevant City entities, community partners, and the technology community. 

The Austin community and city government partners together to collaboratively draft this roadmap to inform City policy decision-making, help the community tackle local challenges, and help the city improve service delivery.

City Council has asked that our strategic roadmap include the following:
* A common, Austin-centered definition of Smart Cities
* A statement of vision about Austin's Smart Cities future
* Challenges on which we should focus and prioritize
* Potential opportunities to address those challenges
* Key goals and outcomes operationally for the City and for residents' equitable quality of life
* An inventory of practices to consider
* Core needs, gaps, and capabilities to deliver
* Potential resources and means for partnering and financing initiatives
* A prioritized list of projects to pursue.

The pages that follow detail our learnings as of mid-May 2017, and will be updated as new learnings become available. In the coming months, we will be seeking feedback on the framework of the roadmap, we will seek to standardize how we frame the inventory of smart city projects, and work to align these projects to the City Council Strategic Planning effort already under way.
