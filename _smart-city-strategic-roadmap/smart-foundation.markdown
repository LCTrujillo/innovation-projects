*"Moore’s Law ... is really about people’s belief system, it’s not a law of physics, it’s about human belief, and when people believe in something, they’ll put energy behind it to make it come to pass."*

A Smart Foundation for the Austin's Smart City Strategic Roadmap includes being holistic and specific about those principles we value and prioritize, while establishing norms around the creative tensions and potential conflicts that may arise. This section intends to identify those core principles of consequence to smart cities, how the Austin community prioritizes those key principles, and how the community foresees ways in the near term, medium term, and long term to express these values in concrete actions.

# Principles

A concept of consequence to smart cities. During and after the April 18 Smart Cities Council Readiness Workshop, we asked for advice on participants through our insights campaign. We learned:

"Evaluating and prioritizing Smart City projects requires the City engage all residents to understand existing needs and accessibility of solutions."

"Contributors offered varying definitions of “smart,” referencing the use of solutions and technology as well as the outcomes that could be advanced."

"The City should consider how projects impact geographic, racial, socioeconomic, and other types of equity, including unintended negative consequences."

## Accessibility

## Equity

## Inclusion

## Privacy

## Security

## Transparency

## Resilience

# Values

How the community prioritizes key principles in terms of desirability, and worth

## Areas of Focus

## Trade-offs

# Norms

How the community expresses its values. Every innovation begins as a deviation to a norm. Therefore norms around creative tension and conflict are critically important.

The norms will be best described by the activities that we should undertake in the near term, medium term, and longer term. Such as defining our approach to opt in or opt out policies, or hiring a consultant or team to build out an accessibility tooklit.

This leads us to the Strategic Roadmap - activities for the near term, medium term, long term.
