# History of Austin's Open & Smart Initiatives

The City of Austin's Smart City initiatives will rest on a foundation of open government and other organizational innovation initiatives.

* In 2010, we created the Sustainability Office 
* In 2011, we completed the Imagine Austin Comprehensive Plan and committed to Open Government through a City Council Resolution
* In 2012, the community voted to invest in the creation of the [Dell Medical School](https://dellmed.utexas.edu/community-investment), now an anchor for smart health initiatives
* In 2013, the city began implementing its open data initiative, entered into a partnership with Google Fiber, and city council initiated a discussion board to be transparent in online deliberations.
* In 2014, the city co-created a Digital Inclusion Strategic plan to help close the digital divide, and added an Innovation Office
* In 2015, the city initiated a Community Engagement Task Force to determine ways to better engage Austinites
* In 2016, the city added an Equity Office, to insure equitable outcomes for all Austinites and a Performance Management Office, to ensure accountability for performance. The city also participated in and initiated 3 foundational smart city initiatives: the U.S. Department of Transportation Smart Cities Challenge, Phase 1 of Small Cell Deployment in the downtown core, and joined the U.S. Ignite Smart Gigabit Community

Preparation for this Smart City Strategic Roadmap began in 2016, and will continue iteratively.
