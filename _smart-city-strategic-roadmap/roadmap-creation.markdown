# Current status

As of May 15, 2017, we have made some progress against these goals, but have more work to do to get the roadmap to it's first full draft.

We've made significant progress on getting an Austin-centered definition of Smart Cities and statement of vision about our future, as well as creating an inventory of practices to consider, and identifying needs, gaps, capabilities to deliver.

We have much more work to do prioritize challenges and opportunities, identify resources and means for partnering and financing initiatives, create a list of projects, and align to key goals and outcomes identified by City Council and Management through the Office of Performance Management.

# How we got to now

Preparation for this Smart City Strategic Roadmap began in 2016 through a series of workshops, and will continue iteratively. In parallel to these efforts, the City has been working to create an [adaptive strategic plan](https://austinstrategicplan.bloomfire.com/) that sets outcome goals and targets for the next three to five years. The City has also joined a pilot with the [Open Government Partnership](https://opengovpartnership.bloomfire.com/?feed=recent) to create project commitments to make government more accountable, transparent, participatory, with integrated use of technology and innovation methods.
