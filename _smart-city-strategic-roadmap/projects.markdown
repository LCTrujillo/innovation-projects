As part of the Smart City Strategic Roadmap, we are compiling an inventory of projects that involve the use of technology to solve real problems for real people.\* We started collecting this list of projects to understand the types of smart city/open government projects (and opportunities) City departments are involved in, as well as what challenges these projects face in achieving their goals. We are using this information to identify and prioritize what resources and guidance the City should create or make available to help projects succeed.

This is a living repository of projects that began in September 2016 and continues to grow. One reason it continues grow is that many city departments are doing "smart" things, yet very few are calling them "smart city" projects. Instead, they used language such as "Strategic Management Information & Planning Tools" or "Resource Management in Facilities" or "Automated Demand Response."

*\*When we talk about "smart cities", we always talk about "open government" too. In government, we strive to be "open by default" -- to use open source code, publish data in the open, and share with the public the information we collect. These same guideposts should be true of smart cities projects as well.*
