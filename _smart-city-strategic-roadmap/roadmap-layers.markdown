# Definition

The [International Standards Organization Technical Management Board](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/developing_standards/docs/en/smart_cities_report-jtc1.pdf) established this working definition of Smart Cities in 2014:

A smart city is one that dramatically increases the pace at which it improves its sustainability and resilience by fundamentally improving: 
(i) how it engages society, 
(ii) how it applies collaborative leadership methods,
(iii) how it works across disciplines and city systems, and 
(iv) how it uses data and integrated technologies
in order to transform services and quality of life to those in and involved with the city (residents, business, visitors)

We propose adapting this definition to be Austin's strategic intent:

We are a city that becomes increasingly efficient in solving real problems for real people by: 
(i) engaging stakeholders and users, 
(ii) leading collaboratively,
(iii) working across disciplines, departments, and city systems; and 
(iv) using data and integrated technologies
to transform services and improve quality of life with and for **all** Austinites, businesses, and visitors.
