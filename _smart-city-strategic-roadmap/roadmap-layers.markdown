# Definition

The [International Standards Organization Technical Management Board](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/developing_standards/docs/en/smart_cities_report-jtc1.pdf) established this working definition of Smart Cities in 2014:

A smart city is one that dramatically increases the pace at which it improves its sustainability and resilience by fundamentally improving: 
(i) how it engages society, 
(ii) how it applies collaborative leadership methods,
(iii) how it works across disciplines and city systems, and 
(iv) how it uses data and integrated technologies
in order to transform services and quality of life to those in and involved with the city (residents, business, visitors)

We propose adapting this definition to be Austin's strategic intent:

We are a city that becomes increasingly efficient in solving real problems for real people by: 
(i) engaging stakeholders and users, 
(ii) leading collaboratively,
(iii) working across disciplines, departments, and city systems; and 
(iv) using data and integrated technologies
to transform services and improve quality of life with and for **all** Austinites, businesses, and visitors.

This definition does three things to represent Austin values: 
1. It complements our open government commitments to be participatory, transparent, accountable, and integrate technology and innovation methods.
2. It incorporates Austin values of inclusion, accessibility, and equity.
3. It takes the hype out of Smart Cities by grounding it to the purpose of solving problems, with the essential ingredients of engagement, leadership, collaboration in addition to the use of integrated technologies and data.

# Maturity Model

A good roadmap will tell you are as well as where you are going.  To this end, our roadmap will use a maturity model to help the City as an organization continue to improve our problem-solving capabilities.

The maturity model aligns to the four components of the definition:
* Engage stakeholders and users
* Lead collaboratively
* Work across disciplines, city Departments, and systems
* Integrate technology and data, in a way that evolves our
* Problem-solving capabilities
