During and after the April 18 Smart Cities Council Readiness Workshop, we asked participants for insights and learned:

"The City needs a better identified entryway to intake, evaluate, and provide feedback to specific solutions and technologies."

"The City needs a stronger capability for forming and managing public-private partnerships to address financing, risk, diversity, equity, and asset management."

"Improvements to the Cityâ€™s procurement process are critical to the success (and even initiation) of projects."

## Business Models

How we organize around key resources and activities that deliver upon a value proposition to city residents and customers, while balancing cost structures between private sector revenue streams and public sector funds, financing

## Government as a Platform

What does City government need to do to establish itself as a platform and enabler of Smart Cities?

## Partnerships

What kind of public-private partnerships, strategic alliances, programs such as Entrepreneurs or Start-ups in Residence do we need to flourish as a Smart City?
