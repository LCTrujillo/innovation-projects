*“Personalized e-government services increase citizen satisfaction and compliance while reducing mistakes and misunderstandings that can occur when they are forced to dig up information on their own.”* - Darren Bates in [The Secret Sauce of a Successful Smart City](https://austinstartups.com/the-secret-sauce-of-a-successful-smart-city-2b4967f70f71).

## Outcomes
Demonstrate tangible outcomes and experiences for Austin residents.

## Value Proposition
A belief from the customer about how value (benefit) will be delivered, experienced and acquired

## Data as a Service
Reusable, open data and open interfaces (APIs), enable data from one service to be combined with data from another to create interesting data combination and integration

During and after the April 18 Smart Cities Council Readiness Workshop, we asked for advice on participants through our insights campaign. We learned:

"The City should value data as an asset in service delivery and partnerships in ways that: 1) respect intellectual property; 2) assess the cost of unauthorized disclosure; 3) address data ownership; and, 4) inform partnerships."
