*"Of all the prospects raised by the evolution of digital culture, the most tantalizing is the possibility that technology could fuse with politics to create a more civil society." [Jon Katz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Katz)*

# Strategic Intent
*A statement with a point of view about the future, a sense of discovery and destiny that focuses attention, motivates, guides resources, allows for flexible implementation.*

# Decision-Making
*Policies and process for framing, making, and weighing trade-offs. Data-informed decisions require 1) reliable quantitative and qualitative data, 2) active consideration of data*

During and after the April 18 Smart Cities Council Readiness Workshop, we asked for advice on participants through our insights campaign. We learned:

"The City needs to identify the decision makers and explain the decision-making process for Smart City projects."

"Contributors suggested the City measure against benchmarks (some of which already exist) so that Austin can check progress against achieving our goals."

"Contributors suggest that the City needs to facilitate connections and leverage existing programs supporting City Council outcomes."

# Governance
*The way the rules, norms, standards, and actions are structured, sustained, and regulated; and how teams are held accountable.*
