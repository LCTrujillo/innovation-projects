*The unit of delivery is the team.* - [UK Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/10/26/what-weve-learnt-about-scaling-agile/)

When the City of Austin applied for the U.S. Department of Transportation Smart City Challenge in 2016, we had the best, most diverse, cross-disciplinary, cross-sector team imaginable. By all accounts, the work this team did to answer the call advanced our progress on Smart Cities by about 3-4 years. The secret sauce is the team.

## Agile
Self-organizing, cross-functional teams collaborate and plan adaptively, deliver early, while responding flexibly to change.

## Human-centered
Teams meaningfully include the community in the design, production, and delivery of public value; they design with, not for, the community.

## Iterative
Teams begin with discovery, and iterate through testing and experimentation: they prioritize efforts on problems worth solving, and opportunities worth seizing.
