*The unit of delivery is the team.* - [UK Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/10/26/what-weve-learnt-about-scaling-agile/)

## Agile
Self-organizing, cross-functional teams collaborate and plan adaptively, deliver early, while responding flexibly to change.

## Human-centered
Teams meaningfully include the community in the design, production, and delivery of public value; they design with, not for, the community.

## Iterative
Teams begin with discovery, and iterate through testing and experimentation: they prioritize efforts on problems worth solving, and opportunities worth seizing.
