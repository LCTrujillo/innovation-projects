The Council on April 5, 2017, affirmed a vision and six outcomes to guide the City of Austin over the next 3 to 5 years. These, along with indicators below, establish a framework for developing the City of Austin's adaptive strategic plan.

Our Strategic Outcomes

Together we strive to create a complete community where every Austinite has choices at every stage of life that allow us to experience and contribute to all of the following outcomes:

* **Economic Opportunity and Affordability:** Having economic opportunities and resources that enable us to thrive in our community.
* **Mobility:** Getting us where we want to go, when we want to get there, safely and cost-effectively.
* **Safety:** Being safe in our home, at work, and in our community.
* **Health:** Enjoying a sustainable environment and a healthy life, physically and mentally.
* **Cultural and Learning Opportunities:** Being enriched by Austin’s unique civic, cultural, ethnic, and learning opportunities.
* **Government that works:** Believing that city government works effectively and collaboratively for all of us—that it is equitable, ethical and innovative.

Our Indicators

For each outcome area, we will measure and report on Austin’s progress using a number of metrics – some collected by the City and some collected by other organizations. These metrics will focus on the key indicator areas identified under each outcome below. In addition to ensuring that they meet criteria for effective performance measurement, we will also strive to develop metrics that provide insights into the degree to which Austin’s performance in that area is equitable, affordable, and innovative.
