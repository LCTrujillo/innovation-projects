We are currently in the process of standardizing and refining our inventory of Smart City projects.

When talking to many of our colleagues, we learned that there are a lot of projects going on, yet no one was calling the "smart city projects." Instead, they used language such as "Strategic Management Information & Planning Tools" or "Resource Management in Facilities" or "Automated Demand Response."

While we refine our inventory and develop this showcase, please visit [our Smart Austin Community of Practice](https://smartaustin.bloomfire.com/) for articles and case studies we've collected.
