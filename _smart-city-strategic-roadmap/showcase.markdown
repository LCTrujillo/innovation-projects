As part of the Smart City Strategic Roadmap, we are compiling an inventory of projects that involve the use of technology to solve real problems for real people.* We started collecting this list of projects to understand the types of smart city/open government projects (and opportunities) City departments are involved in, as well as what challenges these projects face in achieving their goals. CTM, TARA, and the Innovation Office are using this information to identify and prioritize what resources and guidance the City should create or make available to help projects succeed.

*When we talk about "smart cities", we always talk about "open government" too. We see these concepts as closely related. In government, we strive to be "open by default" -- to use open source code, publish data in the open, and generally share with the public the information we collect. These same guideposts should be true of smart cities projects as well.* 

When talking to many of our colleagues, we learned that there are a lot of projects going on, yet no one was calling them "smart city projects." Instead, they used language such as "Strategic Management Information & Planning Tools" or "Resource Management in Facilities" or "Automated Demand Response."

While we refine our inventory and develop this showcase, please visit [our Smart Austin Community of Practice](https://smartaustin.bloomfire.com/) for articles and case studies we've collected.
