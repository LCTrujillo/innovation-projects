Here you’ll find an overview of a project to create an online tracking interface for City of Austin projects. This effort is a partnership between the City of Austin’s [Communication and Technology Management department](https://www.austintexas.gov/techreport/communications-and-technology-management) and the [Office of Innovation](https://cityofaustin.github.io/innovation/). This effort is also a commitment the City of Austin has made as part of its participation in the [Open Government Partnership subnational pilot program](https://opengovpartnership.bloomfire.com/posts/1315600-austin-s-open-government-partnership-action-plan). ![Open Government Partnership logo](/uploads/OGP_logo.png)
