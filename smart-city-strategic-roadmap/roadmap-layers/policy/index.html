<p>During and after the April 18, 2017 Smart Cities Council Readiness Workshop, we asked for advice from participants through an <a href="http://insights.austintexas.gov/Austin/1001/insights">insights campaign</a>. We learned:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The City needs to identify the decision makers and explain the decision-making process for Smart City projects.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Contributors suggested the City measure against benchmarks (some of which already exist) so that Austin can check progress against achieving our goals.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Contributors suggest that the City needs to facilitate connections and leverage existing programs supporting City Council outcomes.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Improvements to the City’s procurement process are critical to the success (and even initiation) of projects.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Contributors suggested that Smart City projects should be flexible and adaptable over time.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Contributors suggested that the City approach Smart Cities with a regional and geographically-distributed focus instead of concentrating solutions or ignoring interconnectedness of systems.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The City needs to effectively engage all residents to account for the value proposition of projects based on existing needs and accessibility of solutions.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The City needs a better identified entryway for specific solutions and technologies to be heard and receive feedback.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Smart City projects that should be balanced with a focus on both existing needs and future-oriented opportunities.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The City should value data as an asset in service delivery and partnerships in ways that: 1) respect intellectual property; 2) assess the cost of unauthorized disclosure; 3) address data ownership; and, 4) inform partnerships.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Contributors noted many considerations for managing Smart Cities as a program, including: goals, maturity, measures, value/cost drivers, critical infrastructure, and key resources.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is a need for a concerted effort on privacy and security that includes policies, processes, and staffing.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Contributors said the city needs to enable a state of readiness for agile and iterative implementation of projects.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The City needs to develop guidance to support prototyping and experimenting in an ethical and transparent way.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="challenge-areas-identified">Challenge areas identified</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How might we provide transparent governance of smart city projects?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How might we measure our progress in achieving smart city goals compared to other cities?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How might we use the City Council’s strategic outcomes to prioritize smart city projects?</p>
  </li>
