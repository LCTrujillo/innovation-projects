        <h1 id="current-status">Current status</h1>

<p>As of May 15, 2017, we have made some progress against these goals, but have more work to do to get the roadmap to it’s first full draft.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Smart%20City%20Roadmap%20Goal%20-%20Progress.png" alt="Smart City Roadmap Goal - Progress.png" /></p>

<p>We’ve made significant progress on getting an Austin-centered definition of Smart Cities and statement of vision about our future, as well as creating an inventory of practices to consider, and identifying needs, gaps, capabilities to deliver.</p>

<p>We have much more work to do prioritize challenges and opportunities, identify resources and means for partnering and financing initiatives, create a list of projects, and align to key goals and outcomes identified by City Council and Management through the Office of Performance Management.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Smart%20City%20Roadmap%20Project%20%20Phases.png" alt="Smart City Roadmap Project  Phases.png" /></p>

<h1 id="discovery-phase">Discovery Phase</h1>

<p>Preparation for this Smart City Strategic Roadmap began in 2016 through a series of workshops, and <a href="https://smartaustin.bloomfire.com/">desk research</a>, and will continue iteratively. In parallel to these efforts, the City has been working to create an <a href="https://austinstrategicplan.bloomfire.com/">Adaptive Strategic Plan</a> that sets outcome goals and targets for the next three to five years. The City has also joined a pilot with the <a href="https://opengovpartnership.bloomfire.com/?feed=recent">Open Government Partnership</a> to create project commitments to make government more accountable, transparent, participatory, with integrated use of technology and innovation methods.</p>

<h1 id="what-weve-learned">What we’ve learned</h1>

<p>During and after the Smart Cities Council Readiness Workshop, we asked for the advice of partners and stakeholders and received a lot  key insights that will shape the roadmap. We synthesized <a href="http://insights.austintexas.gov/Austin/1001/answers">18 insights out of 129 answers</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Evaluating and prioritizing Smart City projects requires the City engage all residents to understand existing needs and accessibility of solutions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contributors suggested the City measure against benchmarks (some of which already exist) so that Austin can check progress against achieving our goals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The City needs a better identified entryway to intake, evaluate, and provide feedback to specific solutions and technologies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The City needs a stronger capability for forming and managing public-private partnerships to address financing, risk, diversity, equity, and asset management.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The City needs to develop guidance to support prototyping and experimenting in an ethical and transparent way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contributors offered varying definitions of “smart,” referencing the use of solutions and technology as well as the outcomes that could be advanced.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The City should value data as an asset in service delivery and partnerships in ways that: 1) respect intellectual property; 2) assess the cost of unauthorized disclosure; 3) address data ownership; and, 4) inform partnerships.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The City needs to identify the decision makers and explain the decision-making process for Smart City projects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Investment in the right skillsets, diverse perspectives, and human capital for the City is critical to the success (and even initiation) of projects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The City should consider how projects impact geographic, racial, socioeconomic, and other types of equity, including unintended negative consequences.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improvements to the City’s procurement process are critical to the success (and even initiation) of projects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contributors suggested that the City approach Smart Cities with a regional and geographically-distributed focus instead of concentrating solutions or ignoring interconnectedness of systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a need for a concerted effort on privacy and security that includes policies, processes, and staffing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Projects should be continuously learning and adapting, powered by technology that enables flexibility and avoids vendor lock-in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contributors noted many considerations for managing Smart Cities as a program, including: goals, maturity, measures, value/cost drivers, critical infrastructure, and key resources.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contributors said the city needs to enable a state of readiness for agile and iterative implementation of projects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contributors suggest that the City needs to facilitate connections and leverage existing programs supporting City Council outcomes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="history-of-austins-open-and-smart-initiatives">History of Austin’s Open and Smart Initiatives</h1>

<p>The City of Austin’s Smart City initiatives will rest on a foundation of open government and other organizational innovation initiatives.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/History%20of%20Open%20and%20Smart.png" alt="History of Open and Smart" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In 2010, we created the Sustainability Office</p>
  </li>

    <p>In 2011, we completed the Imagine Austin Comprehensive Plan and committed to Open Government through a City Council Resolution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 2012, the community voted to invest in the creation of the <a href="https://dellmed.utexas.edu/community-investment">Dell Medical School</a>, now an anchor for smart health initiatives</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 2013, the city began implementing its open data initiative, entered into a partnership with Google Fiber, and city council initiated a discussion board to be transparent in online deliberations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 2014, the city co-created a Digital Inclusion Strategic plan to help close the digital divide, and added an Innovation Office</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 2015, the city initiated a Community Engagement Task Force to determine ways to better engage Austinites</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 2016, the city added an Equity Office, to insure equitable outcomes for all Austinites and a Performance Management Office, to ensure accountability for performance. The city also participated in and initiated 3 foundational smart city initiatives: the U.S. Department of Transportation Smart Cities Challenge, Phase 1 of Small Cell Deployment in the downtown core, and joined the U.S. Ignite Smart Gigabit Community</p>
  </li>
</ul>
