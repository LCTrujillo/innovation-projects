# Discovering Austin’s Digital Services Needs

![image of tech stack sprint review meeting](/uploads/techabout.jpg)

Austintexas.gov’s current version was released in 2012. This is a website that serves a population of over 1 million residents, garners 41 million pageviews a year, and hosts 600 users who manage almost 12,000 pages. Since its release, the technology team’s focus has been limited to general site maintenance and management of content owners/editors, which makes sense, because there are 900 support requests on this site per year, and 2 full-time employees to handle all these requests.

During the 2017 spring retreat, Austin’s City Council declared their intention to create a government that works for everyone, which you can read more about in the [Smart City Strategic Roadmap](http://projects.austintexas.io/smart-city-strategic-roadmap/).

To this end, the Design, Technology, and Innovation fellows and partners are kicking off a project to discover Austin’s current digital services landscape, and recommend a technology framework that meets the needs of users both on the city side and the resident side.
