# Discovering Austin’s Digital Services Needs

![image of tech stack sprint review meeting](/uploads/techabout.jpg)

The City of Austin provides a number of digital services to its residents. Services include Austin recycling and trash schedules, getting in line for your driver’s license, registering your kids for summer camp, and other goals residents can accomplish–online. Austin residents rely on digital services more and more every day and city teams realize how important it is to meet their expectations. During the 2017 spring retreat, Austin’s City Council declared their intention to create a government that works for everyone, which you can read more about in the [Smart City Strategic Roadmap](http://projects.austintexas.io/smart-city-strategic-roadmap/).

The Design, Technology, & Innovation Fellows partnered with two City of Austin departments: Communications & Information Management and Communications & Technology Management, to meet that intention and build a better technology foundation for the City of Austin. Our team quickly realized that we needed to define the who, what, why, and how that goes into providing invaluable digital services to Austin residents.
 
This is an overview of our approach to these challenges and progress we’ve made. If you have questions or comments, we want to hear from you:
