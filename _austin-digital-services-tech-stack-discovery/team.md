# Who are we?

## Fellows
The Design, Technology, and Innovation fellows are leading the discovery phase of this project with research, design, prototyping, and testing

## Partners
We’re working with partners from Communications & Public Information Office, Communications and Technology Management, Austin Resource Recovery, Development Services, Parks and Recreation, the Library, and more.

## Users
We have two sets of users of Austin’s digital services. The internal users, who need to be able create, post, edit content, stand up microsites, deploy apps. These users are the focus of this project. But we need you, the resident user, to make sure that these services are working! Stay tuned for opportunities to help us test prototypes and provide feedback.
