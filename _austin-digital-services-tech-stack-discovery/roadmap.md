# What's the Plan?

After just a few meetings of trying to map out our understanding and requirements, we realized there were a few weeks of just Process Alignment work to be done. In other words, in order to come up with a technology stack that met the needs of all the admin and end users, we needed to figure out what’s currently happening, what’s missing, and what’s desired. The technology to support that process will be the easy part as we have seen multiple times for the Innovation projects.

We’ve created a Research Plan that included 1:1 interviews, group sessions, and Expert interviews.
