<p>What I’ve learned in Boating School is …</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/stackdrawing.jpg" alt="photo of stack drawing" /></p>

<h2 id="nobody-likes-being-bombarded-with-email-requests">Nobody likes being bombarded with email requests</h2>
<p>So email was actually not designed with transparent issue tracking in mind. Not only is using email in this capacity a negative experience for the person handling the request, but the person managing those employees is left with no visibility as to what their team’s bandwidth is. Without that visibility, there is no shared understanding of when requests really aren’t able to be filled due to lack of bandwidth, and this can erode trust within a department.</p>

<h2 id="users-feel-happy-when-they-are-empowered-to-make-decisions">Users feel happy when they are empowered to make decisions</h2>
<p>We heard one positive story of an employee recognizing a broken process, coming up with a game plan to fix it, and feeling empowered to make decisions about how best to address it. We also heard negative stories from employees who’ve recognized broken processes, brought them up to their supervisors, and felt their concerns get lost in a black hole of decision-making that took place above their heads.</p>

<h2 id="switching-gears-is-really-hard">Switching gears is really hard</h2>
<p>Our technology staff are responsible for building, deploying and QA testing all of the requests they work on. As one of our interviewees put it “look in any book about tech teams, ever, it will tell you that this is the number one cause of failure.” This boils down to the fact that these are three completely different processes that require different mindsets and technologies. Not only is it cognitively exhausting to keep up with all the statuses of multiple requests, but it is resource exhausting too, as another participant told us, “Switching gears is really hard, it takes time to figure out where you were.”</p>

<h2 id="we-all-want-to-get-better">We all want to get better</h2>
<p>If there is one agreed upon strength of Austin’s digital service organization, it is our growth mindset. “We all want to get better.”</p>
