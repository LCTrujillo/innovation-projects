        <p>We kicked off this project with a lot of feedback from our partners in Watershed Protection about what they would like to see in the redesigned ATXfloods.com. They did their due diligence and even looped in other partners, eliciting feedback from other emergency services departments and from local broadcast media. So why did we need a research phase?</p>

<p>We had the what, but we needed more clarity on the why! We had so many questions about the conditions under which somebody might be using the service, or the decisions that somebody would use this service to make. We wanted to hear from people who used this service to keep the public safe, but we also wanted to hear from the public about how they use this service to keep themselves safe!</p>

<p>Conducting primary research allowed us to get nuanced, qualitative information about the problems we could solve. We were able to gain context of use, really hone in on the benefits that ATXfloods.com already provides, uncover pain points, and then use all this information to prioritize the improvements that we would be recommending.</p>
