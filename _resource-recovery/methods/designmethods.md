## Design Methods

#### Design Goals

* Develop recommendations for possible residential recycling solutions based on prototyping, research, and testing with Austin residents.

* Develop test metrics and execute testing and measuring of possible solutions.

* Recommend improvements to existing print and digital resources.

* Establish methods to track and measure advertising or outreach effectiveness and/or awareness by personas and market segments.

#### Translating Research to Design

The research learnings were a foundation for generating ideas that addressed Austin’s unique recycling challenges. This is our concept generation and evaluation process:

* *Sketch Concepts:* Sketch potential solutions that are inspired by opportunity areas (“how might we…” statements) developed from insights.

* *Define Value Criterias:* Develop simple, concise, concept evaluation criteria that reflects residents’ needs. This also helps the team align on what’s important.

* *Evaluate Concepts:* Use the value criteria to narrow down your big pool of ideas to a small set with greater potential value.

* *Prioritize by Feasibility:* Narrow down concepts again, looking at what can be done in the short-term vs. long-term, with a small budget or a big budget, with or without approval from multiple stakeholders.

#### Design Sprints

Sprints refer to one or two week segments we spent on each round of prototypes. Our goal within each sprint was to build a rough prototype and test with residents so we can determine each prototype’s viability by the end of the sprint.

#### Prototyping

Rapid prototyping a concept is a low-cost and effective method for testing the potential of a new service, product, or message.

* *Frame the Problem:*As a group, we defined a problem statement that a particular concept addressed.

* *Inspiration*: Investigated how other cities / organizations are solving this type of problem

* *Draw It Out:* We hand-drew the prototype on a whiteboard, getting everyone on board for what we were building and testing.

* *User Scenario:* Wrote user scenarios, imagining how the prototype would manifest in the real world.

* *Storyboard:* Small vignettes that help envision the prototype being used to reach a goal or fulfill a need.

* *Form a Hypothesis:* Hypothesized how that idea would solve for the problem and developed metrics to measure this hypothesis.

* *Rough Prototype:* Built the most minimal version of the prototype using paper, foam core, or other appropriate mediums.

#### Usability Testing

Conducted usability tests with residents that either proved or disproved a prototype’s value, helping us to sometimes fail early and move forward.

* *Plan & Recruit:* Coordinated test location and tried to quickly recruit an equitable pool of participants--people with diverse backgrounds, income or education levels, with and without disabilities, non-English speakers, different ages, and more.

* *Complete Test Plan:* For each prototype, we filled out a prototype test plan detailing the methods for testing and the metrics we were gathering.

* *Conduct Usability Test:* Test your rough prototype with the people we’re designing for, in the context they’ll use it.

* *Reflect:* Analyzed qualitative and quantitative findings.

* *How to Proceed:* Determined next steps. Sometimes that meant refining our prototype based on test results, other times that meant scrapping the prototype and moving on because the prototype didn’t test well.

* *Share:* Sometimes we co-created and tested prototypes with Austin Resource Recovery team members, and always shared learnings and outcomes at bi-weekly sprint review meetings.
