## Design Methods

Work in progress. Check back soon!

### Design Goals

The **design phase** is coming up with ideas, testing them out to see what works, and refining the ones that do.

![image of design process](/uploads/designmethods.png)

* Generate as many ideas as possible to solve for opportunity areas found during research
* Systematically evaluate ideas based in insights, personas, and our research framework
* Prototype the feasible ideas at a low fidelity to prove the concepts
* Test the prototypes to evaluate promise and identify opportunity areas

### Concepting

#### [Our Concepting Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17DcFEZe9uUJNj9Yx-QKMvKJ0moaujqpVnU8YN5u96Ys/edit)

**Concepting** is the process of solving for an opportunity area by coming up with an idea that meets a need, and sketching out how it might look in the world.
* be quick, and to the point
* don't invest too much in the details
* don't become attached

Sketch something and move on. Once it's out there, it's out there, and it's not a part of you anymore.

#### Generating Concepts
Generated over 200 concepts. Gathered ideas at different times by different audiences.

* Austin design community @ Austin Design Week Open Data session
* Fellows @ Various stages of research
* ARR Advisory Team @ Final Research Shareout

Treated each concepts equally in our evaluation process. (In fact, we didn't even keep track of where most of them came from. This is to prevent us from giving special treatment to certain ideas based on our own bias.)

### Concept Evaluation

#### 200 -> 25 -> 16 -> 8

Developed a scoring system based on whether or not, and to what degree, the concept met a need identified in research. We pulled out the 25 highest scoring concepts.

Held feedback session with ARR to get that down to 16 prototypes that were feasible, and had high potential impact.

![image of final concepts](/_uploads/lasteval.png)

Selected 8 top concepts to move forward with, based on diversity of solutions.

* Digital vs Physical
* Product vs Service
* Short term vs Long Term

### Prototyping

**Prototyping** is creating scrappy executions of an idea which are thorough enough to prove the concept, but low-investment enough to be thrown out if they show no promise.

#### Prototype Plan

#### [Prototype Plan Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hr-YRHO1b_zIpo5MaaO-co1UfZKlp2A6wBFsUT3bAgM/edit)

Framed each prototype with a good problem statement, and user stories writing user stories, which helped us to have a shared vision on each prototype and collaborate well.

#### Creation Process

##### Inspiration
Investigated how other cities / organizations are solving this type of problem

##### Paper Prototype
#### ![photoofpaperprototype]()
Created experiences on paper before developing digital solution

##### Clickable Prototype
#### ![outreach wires](/_uploads/outreachwires.png)

Created clickable solutions to test the digital experience

##### MVP
#### ![outreach develop](/_uploads/outreachdevelop.png)
Develop working version to test outcomes

### Testing
#### ![arr testing types ](/_uploads/arrtesting.png)

Tested each prototype to conduct

#### Qualitative Testing

##### Talk-alouds
"What did you like about this tool?"

#### Quantitative Testing

##### Existence Testing

"Does this even show promise?"

* Measured the "baseline" for whatever variable we were trying to influences
* Introduced variable to one group
* Re-measured the group after variable
* Analyzed results. Improving scores would indicate promise

###### example:
disposal stations during SXSW. before testing what goes on signage, we wanted to know how much impact signage really makes (learned it's not a lot.)

##### A/B Testing

"Which of these versions work better?"

* Measured the "baseline" for whatever variable we were trying to influences
* split the participants, one group selected A, another selected B
* Re-measured the group after exposure to variable
* Analyzed results. Higher improvement from baseline reveals winning variation

###### example:
list versus flow. if we put the same content in this format versus that format, what will work better?
