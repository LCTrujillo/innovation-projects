## Design Methods

#### Design Goals

* Develop recommendations for possible residential recycling solutions based on prototyping, research, and testing with Austin residents.

* Develop test metrics and execute testing and measuring of possible solutions.

* Recommend improvements to existing print and digital resources.

* Establish methods to track and measure advertising or outreach effectiveness and/or awareness by personas and market segments.

#### Translating Research to Design

The research learnings were a foundation for generating ideas that addressed Austin’s unique recycling challenges. This is our concept generation and evaluation process:

* *Sketch Concepts:* Sketch potential solutions that are inspired by opportunity areas (“how might we…” statements) developed from insights.

* *Define Value Criterias:* Develop simple, concise, concept evaluation criteria that reflects residents’ needs. This also helps the team align on what’s important.

* *Evaluate Concepts:* Use the value criteria to narrow down your big pool of ideas to a small set with greater potential value.

* *Prioritize by Feasibility:* Narrow down concepts again, looking at what can be done in the short-term vs. long-term, with a small budget or a big budget, with or without approval from multiple stakeholders.

#### Design Sprints

Sprints refer to one or two week segments we spent on each round of prototypes. Our goal within each sprint was to build a rough prototype and test with residents so we can determine each prototype’s viability by the end of the sprint.
