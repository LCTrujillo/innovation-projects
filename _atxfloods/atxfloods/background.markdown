##Background

Many residents know that the part of Texas that Austin is located in is known as Hill Country, but what they may not know is that it is also known as [Flash Flood Alley](http://www.lcra.org/water/floods/Pages/default.aspx). This is due to the area's steep terrain, shallow soil, and unusually high rainfall rates. But due to the Texan nature of our rains, many creeks and streams lay dry more often than they are swollen with rain - and so Austin's infrastructure uses something called a low-water crossing to provide bridges over these waterways. A low-water crossing is passable when dry, but during heavy rains they are designed to flood - and with water rushing over a low-water crossing, it is dangerous to pass by car, truck, or foot! (If you're having trouble picturing it, the [Austin American-Statesman](http://www.statesman.com/weather/flash-flood-watch-canceled-dozens-low-water-crossings-closed/q1li4msqoOGExZBDorDbxM/) has a great example.)

In 2012, a Code for America Fellow worked with the Watershed Protection Department to create a simple, lightweight mapping tool to show whether low-water crossings were open or closed. You can read more about that project [here](https://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2012/11/02/mapping-floods/).
