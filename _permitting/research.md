## Foundational Research

Our goals are to (1) understand the ask and clarify project objectives; (2) understand the system and its components, and (3) strategize the user research phase.

To achieve these goals, we interviewed stakeholders from city departments and offices that are connected to this project:

* Development Services Department

* Planning & Zoning

* Health & Human Services

* Watershed

* Transportation

* Fire

* Water

* Energy

* Code

* Austin Center for Events

* CTM

We gathered our data and connected information to create context through a permitting overview.

Foundation research established the following insights:

1. Unclear Relationships

Processes and permits have obscured ownership. No one person has a complete view of whatâ€™s happening in other departments and the extent of their relationships.

2. Focus on Building Permits

Building permits have the most complexity, the most interdepartmental collaboration, and the least clarity. Development Services Department owns the major building permits, most of the process, and has the most customer interaction.

3. Inconsistent Processes and Terminology

Departments enforce their own regulations, employ different processes, and use inconsistent terminology, which creates confusion and complexities.

Foundational research underscored the importance of the underlying processes involved with permitting as a means of making lasting, meaningful improvements.
