## Research

First, we developed a [strategic plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EoEb5Z4G6tDm1_JLSaCS6dVEp-9MCHXpJ8LDxF-LW6w/edit?usp=sharing) to guide our research.

Next, our researchers [conducted interviews](https://airtable.com/shrShppfWhl7gsECM/tbl35leYmYXUEkXSK) with individuals from various backgrounds and disciplines who rely on the cityâ€™s permitting process.

Based on those interviews, we developed a series of [personas](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-koyi3sC5iWcFZ6ZUYyZXRrR2s/view?usp=sharing) and employee profiles to center user needs on both sides of the counter for the design phase of the project.
