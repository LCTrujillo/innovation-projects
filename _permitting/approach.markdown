## Teams

We created 3 interrelated teams to approach the city’s permitting process:

**The Web Resource Team** works to develop intuitive digital presentation of standards and rules for the city’s permitting process. An accessible resource for customers and employees will reinforce the permitting process and establish an educational framework to move projects forward.

**The Service Experience Team** co-creatively designs the customer and employee experiences, as well as the business processes required for responsible delivery of the permitting service. In-Person will enact, adapt, and streamline rules and resources for real-time interactions.

**The Communications Team** translates collaborative processes to daily project management. By designing a workflow for permitting services, the team will establish more comprehensive and accessible internal and external correspondence.
