## Research Phase

### Executive stakeholder interviews

We interviewed these stakeholders to make sense of the project. They informed our project objectives (above) and initial investigation into departments involved in permitting (below).

### Research plan

#### Project Strategy

##### Stakeholder interviews
We were given a list of objectives in our initial contract. Executive stakeholder interviews helped us supplement them then parse it into manageable chunks based on our 3 branches of objectives.

##### Background
We were given an initial list of Advisors to the project from Stacey Wuest. We interviewed these groups to get the lay of the land and identify the key areas to focus on- departments, permit types, user types.

##### Strategy

As the core of the permitting system, the Service defines the whole project. We must  investigate the Service first to understand the problems and identify necessary improvements.  This will then inform what is needed to meet the Sustainment and Engagement objectives.

#### Service Research Plan

##### Understand the Big Picture

Identify what’s needed to meet project objectives through researching

##### Deep Dive on Improvement Areas

What do we need to create, change or support to create a successful permitting service?

### Phases

1. Discovery
  * Identify focus areas by interviewing departments involved in permitting (done)
  * Identify permitting service needs by interviewing customers and shadowing the in-person experience (done)
2. Generative & Evaluative: Targeted investigations in improvement areas (during design phase, upcoming)
  * (note to Julia- make a visual showing the breadth we started with and the focus areas we ended with)

### Department interviews
We interviewed our Advisory team to get the lay of the land and identify the key areas to focus on- departments, permit types, user types.

We spoke with representatives from:

* DSD - Development Assistance Center (DAC), GIS
* Health & Human Services
* Austin Code
* Watershed
* Transportation
* Fire
* Austin Water
* Austin Energy
* Austin Center for Events

### Deliverables
* project strategy
* department relationship maps
* permitting overview maps
* research plan


#### Project strategy

Three main permit categories:

*	Building
* Event and Temporary Use
* Operations

Building is the area to focus on now because it has most interdepartmental collaboration, highest complexity and least clarity. The solution must scale to Event and Operation Permits in the future, which we will inform based on this initial research. DSD is owner of the primary building permits and most of the processes customers interact with.

#### Relationship Maps

Top DSD departments customers engage with are:

  *	DAC
	* Commercial Plan Review
  * Residential Plan Review
  * Land Use Review
  * Service Center
  * Inspections Department

The main users involved are

  * Public ‘customers’ involved in the permit process
  *	Employees- permitting staff
  *	Secondary users are
  *	Public users with stake in building but not involved in acquiring permits
  *	Employees- technical support and maintenance


### Customer interviews

Goal: Identify what’s needed to meet project objectives through researching:

* User needs, process, use cases
* Overall process, dependencies and where it breaks down

Deliverables: Personas, journey maps, insights & opportunities, design principles, strategy for design

* Graph/table of all interviews (have Charli recreate??)
* Pains graphic from Design Week https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8ZfT3Hy63oZaVZNa3pzaHFndEk

blurb/story about the maps with pains called out

* Professionals’ Journey: This walks through the Residential New Build Process, demonstrating the typical experience and pains the Professional Personas encounter.

*	Homeowner Journey 1: This walks through a representative DIYer use case- demolishing a garage and replacing it.

*	Homeowner Journey 2: This walks through a representative use case of a homeowner who outsources construction and permitting to professionals but has to interact with the service at occasional points in the process.
