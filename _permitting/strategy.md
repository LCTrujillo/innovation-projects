# Strategy

## Principles

We kicked off the new year with a workshop to review our research and develop a set of principles to guide design decisions moving forward. These ten principles allow us to ask critical questions of our work.

**Accessible**

Provide information in an open and welcoming manner.

**Connective**

Develop resilient relationships between parties.

**Empowering**

Promote ownership of problems and solutions by city staff.

**Responsive**

Support change and meet arising needs.

**Spirited**

Foster alignment among city departments.

**Accountable**

Share responsibility and mutual support.

**Efficient For The User**

Facilitate a manageable experience for the public.

**Educational**

Share knowledge and promote understanding.

**Transparent**

Reveal the foundation that supports information.

**Intuitive**

Present inherently available tools and processes.

## Tracks

The Permitting Initiative

**The Web Resource Track** works to develop intuitive digital presentation of standards and rules for the cityâ€™s permitting process. An accessible resource for customers and employees will reinforce the permitting process and establish an educational framework to move projects forward.

**The Service Experience Track** co-creatively designs the customer and employee experiences, as well as the business processes required for responsible delivery of the permitting service. In-Person will enact, adapt, and streamline rules and resources for real-time interactions.

**The Alignment Track** is focused on helping the city achieve cohesion and alignment among departments implementing city code and permitting policies. By identifying collaborative opportunities to maintain a sustainable permitting process, the team will create a foundation for Web and Service design.

**The Communications Track** translates collaborative processes to daily project management. By designing a workflow for permitting services, the team will establish more comprehensive and accessible internal and external correspondence.
