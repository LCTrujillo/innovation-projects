<p>The Downtown Austin Alliance 5-year strategic plan includes the goal of providing leadership, advocacy and direct funding to reduce the number of chronically homeless downtown by 25% by 2017. This is one goal among others related to improving public safety and addressing homelessness and social services-related issues.</p>

<p>The current one-year milestones for that goal include supporting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the development and implementation of a plan with the City’s Innovation Office and key stakeholders to improve safety around ARCH and more effectively move people into services, shelter and housing.</li>
  <li>the City of Austin Neighborhood Housing &amp; Community Development to issue an RFP by October 2016 to develop the city’s second, Housing First project with a minimum of 50-units. (This RFP was released in April. ATCIC’s Oak Springs 50-unit project is the first Housing First project in the city.)</li>
  <li>approvals needed for development of Oak Springs Housing First project ground breaking by fall 2016.</li>
  <li>approvals needed to begin phase II of Community First Village.</li>
</ul>
