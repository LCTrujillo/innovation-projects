## Welcome!

We are Design, Technology, and Innovation (DTI) Fellows with the City of Austin and you've made it to our project documentation site. This site features the collaboration between [DTI Fellows](https://cityofaustin.github.io/innovation-fellows/) and [Austin Resource Recovery](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/austin-resource-recovery) (ARR) to come up with new approaches to reaching the city's goal of Zero Waste by 2040. Here you will see the latest progress of our work, the research and design methods used by the Fellows, and key project outcomes.

We hope our research and design findings will be useful for city staff who are making key decisions regarding recycling and composting services and programs. We hope our methods are useful for departments who wish to do similar work. We also want this site to be a behind the scene peek at what it looks and feels like to be designers and researchers embedded at the local government level. We hope this information is inspiring and useful.

If you have questions or comments, we would love to hear from you.
