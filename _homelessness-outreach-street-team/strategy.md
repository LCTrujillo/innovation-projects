HOST was designed to fit into and reinforce community commitment for Austin’s larger strategy of ending community homelessness.

In January 2017, Bloomberg Philanthropies awarded a grant to the City of Austin for the hire of an innovation team to support HOST's efforts. The innovation team will focus on data sharing and integration, service design, and shared reasoning around homelessness.

## Guiding Principles

- Meet people where they are at
- Build trust and relationships
- Do no harm
- Work with humility and compassion
- Protect vulnerable individuals and the community at large
- Share wisdom and experience with service providers and community

## Shared Purpose and Intent

Streamlined, accelerated collaborations between public safety agencies and service providers enable the right intervention with the right resource at the right time to:
- protect vulnerable individuals at risk of deteriorating
- interrupt hostile/aggressive behaviors 
- prevent crisis and crime 
in a way that supports access to services and housing.


## Shared Outcomes

The team contributes to the Ending Community Homelessness Coalition’s goals of maximizing system effectiveness.

Policy makers, funders, and the broader Austin community have a shared understanding of of the system that solves for homelessness. 

The team contributes to the Ending Community Homelessness Coalition’s goal of addressing inequalities and disparities of minorities and persons with lived experience of homelessness

Services and other solutions are developed with, not for, persons with lived experience of homelessness, and those responsible for delivering services.

## Coordinating and Collaborating Strategically

Some possible outcomes for Bloomberg Innovation Team:
- Create Digital and non-digital tools for knowledge sharing across network of providers
- Creat opportunities for people who care and want to engage to have ways to participate in helping to end homelessness.
