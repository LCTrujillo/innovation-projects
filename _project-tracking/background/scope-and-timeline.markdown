## Scope

This is a four-month project that will have three main parts: (1) Discovery, (2) Design & Testing, and (3) Integration & Sustainment
 
Outcomes we aim to achieve:

* Better understanding of what projects the City is working on, status, funding--for public and City staff

* Increased public engagement and commitment to civic goals

* More collaboration among City departments and with the community

## Timeline and project phases

The project will run from May 2017 - August 2017. Because we practice iterative design, when and how we may be executing tasks is likely to shift to meet the projectâ€™s needs. The below phases will overlap. 
 
### Discovery (2 months)

Interviews with public stakeholders and City staff to understand challenges and opportunities regarding an open project tracking tool. Expected deliverables:

* Discovery plan for user needs (public stakeholders and City staff, producers and consumers of information) and technology
* Report out on existing project management platforms
* Report out on public and inter-departmental interests in projects
* Decision about what information about projects will be collected

### Design & Testing (2 months)

Design and prototype project tracking tool options based on insights from the discovery stage, and test them with different types of users. Expected deliverables:

* Wireframes (design blueprints) of possible solutions
* Alpha release of project tracking interface
* Online resource for viewing work in progress and tracking issues, questions, and feature requests from the community

### Extend, Integrate, & Sustain (1 month)

Refine the design, content, and implementation of the tracking interface and explore how we might integrate it in other teams/projects. Expected deliverables:

* Beta release of project tracking interface 
* Live release of project tracking interface
* Prioritized backlog of potential improvements
* Roadmap for intake/integration with project management systems
* Sustainability plan: roles, responsibilities, and processes for managing the solution and its iteration after the project
